                MARCH 2019-SEPTEMBER 2019
CHILD MINDING
· I provided weekly child-care for 18-months-old twins during evenings and weekends. This involved a high level of responsibility and care, as well as patience, empathy and the ability to adapt my communication skills to address both the children and their parents.

TEACHING ASSISTANT, WORK EXPERIENCE
· I acted as a teaching assistant in computing, this involved assisting both the teacher and the students in the classroom, e.g. helping students with their work by using my own computing experience to adapt their knowledge, thus helping to further their education in the subject.
· Ensured health and safety was maintained, dealt with technical failures and built my communication skills on a professional level when conversing with teachers as my colleagues rather than my educators.
